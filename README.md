# Small Python Projects

A collection of small, practical Python projects designed for **beginner to intermediate** programmers who want to level up their skills through hands-on coding.

These projects focus on core Python concepts (variables, loops, functions, conditionals, file I/O, basic classes, modules, etc.) while slowly introducing more interesting libraries and real-world applications.

Perfect for:
- Python newcomers wanting to move beyond tutorials
- People preparing for coding interviews
- Anyone who learns best by building real (but small) things

## Current Projects

Each project lives in its own folder with its own README explaining what it does, what you'll learn, and how to run it.

| Project Folder              | Description                              | Key Concepts Covered                     | Difficulty |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------|
| [basic_calculator](basic_calculator/)     | Simple command-line calculator           | Functions, conditionals, user input, error handling | Beginner   |
| [investment_calculator](investment_calculator/) | Compound interest & investment growth simulator | Loops, math operations, formatting output, maybe lists/dicts | Beginner → Intermediate |
| [number_guessing_game](number_guessing_game/) | A fun game where the user guesses a random number | Loops, random module, conditionals, user input | Beginner   |
| [temp_converter](temp_converter/)         | Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit / Kelvin converter  | Functions, type conversion, basic math   | Beginner   |

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tm4rtin17/small-python-projects.git
   cd small-python-projects
   ```

## How to Contribute

Contributions are very welcome — this repo is meant to grow with the community!

### Ways to contribute
- Add a new small project (keep it beginner/intermediate friendly)
- Improve existing projects (better comments, error handling, tests, features)
- Add tests (using unittest or pytest)
- Write better READMEs for individual projects
- Fix typos, formatting, or bugs
- Suggest new project ideas in [Discussions](https://github.com/tm4rtin17/small-python-projects/discussions) or Issues

### Steps to add your project
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new folder in the root (use snake_case, e.g. password_generator)
3. Add your code files + a short README.md inside the folder explaining:
   - What the project does
   - What Python concepts it practices
   - How to run it
   - Any libraries needed (requirements.txt if >0 dependencies)
4. Commit your changes with a clear message
5. Open a Pull Request with a description of what you added and why it's useful for learners

### Please keep projects:
- Self-contained (minimal or no external libraries when possible)
- Well-commented and easy to understand
